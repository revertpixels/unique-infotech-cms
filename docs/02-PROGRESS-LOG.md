### [2026-11-02 04:18] Version 1.0.0 — Phase 1 · Step 1

**What was built:**
- storage.rules — replaced corrupted pasted text with deny-all baseline rules
- firestore.rules — set to deny-all baseline rules
- .gitignore — added .idea/ entry
- docs/05-FILE-INDEX.md — renamed batch-heads references to branch-heads
- docs/03-DECISIONS.md — added decision 11: Interim Security Rules

**Why:**
- Lock Firebase Storage and Firestore behind production deny-all rules before any feature code; storage.rules contained ~320 KB of pasted chat text instead of valid rules.

**Files touched (created / modified / deleted):**
- MODIFIED: storage.rules
- MODIFIED: firestore.rules
- MODIFIED: .gitignore
- MODIFIED: docs/05-FILE-INDEX.md
- MODIFIED: docs/03-DECISIONS.md

**Firestore changes:**
- Rule files set to deny-all baseline; no data changes.

**Tested on:**
- Chrome Desktop: N/A (rules-only change)
- Mobile (Android Chrome): N/A

**Edge cases checked:** None.

**Known issues created (if any):**
- Real role-based rules deferred to Phase 1 Step 3.

**Next task:**
- Phase 1 Step 2: build firebase-config.js + app.js + variables.css
